CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN.
### Architecture 
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in utilizing Express HTML, JavaScript, and building a Single Page Application (SPA). The backend infrastructure relied on Node.js and Express to serve the website while establishing connectivity with a MongoDB database. Leveraging the scalability and adaptable nature of NoSQL databases, we capitalized on MongoDB's capacity to accommodate dynamic changes. Additionally, the integration of Mongoose facilitated efficient data collection and object modeling.

On the frontend, we crafted a responsive SPA using Angular. Employing a SPA architecture significantly enhanced the site's navigation speed, ensuring swift loading times for a seamless user experience.

### Functionality

Distinguishing JSON from JavaScript lies in its standardized format for object data representation, easily interpretable by JavaScript to construct literal JavaScript objects. This streamlined compatibility facilitates JavaScript's seamless transformation of data into JavaScript objects, thereby bridging the gap between frontend and backend development. JSON serves as a conduit for storing data or JavaScript objects on the backend, accessible for various purposes as requested by the frontend. This centralized data storage eliminates redundancy, allowing for versatile utilization without repetitive storage.

Regarding code refactoring in the full stack process to enhance functionality and efficiency, a significant instance involved optimizing the trip card and trip list components. Originally, maintaining two separate components rendering identical information proved inefficient. Instead, rendering each trip as a distinct element within the whole system significantly improved the site's overall functionality. Reusing UI components offers manifold benefits, reducing the application's overall size, expediting the development process, and mitigating the introduction of errors or vulnerabilities into the system, given the component's security.
